# PubHTML5-Downloader

**PUBHTML5 Downloader** converted and updated using C#. 

The original file was written by Adamopoulos Vasileios in Python. I converted it and modified it using C#. If you want to see the original [here](https://gitlab.com/adamvas/pubhtml5-downloader) is the link to the gitlab project.

I uploaded the entire solution. The release exe will output the pdf in the folder it is used in.

If there are any errors or you have suggestions please send me a message on here.

**Step 2:** Enter the number of pages for the book.

**Step 3:** Enter the desired file name. If you leave this blank the file will default to "output.pdf"
